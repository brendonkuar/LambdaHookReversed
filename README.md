# LambdaHookReversed
The program ran to inject the DLL is NOT a rat.
The program/Loader you downloaded from the website is actually a Loader used to call this EXE and run it, it finds csgo.exe(32bit) and injects the DLL, since the DLL is embedded into the application.
I simply reversed it to see it's functions but nothing looks suspicious from here. Lambdahook is indeed. NOT a rat.
